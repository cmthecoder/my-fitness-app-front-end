## Description

My Personal Fitness is an app made for those who love to stay active. I wanted to practice making a MERN stack app with authentication and decided to create one about fitness. I didn't want the app to be too large or overly complicated, so I decided to make it simple. Anyone who wants to use this app has to sign up so that their added workouts can be tracked. A user can add the name of the workout, amount of weight being used, and the reps per set.
